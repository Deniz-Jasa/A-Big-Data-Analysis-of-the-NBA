**Author:** Deniz Jasarbasic

**Project Prompts:** Performing a single and multi-variable comparative analysis of the 3PT Revolution and its affects on the deep mid-range shot 
using big data, advanced statistical modeling, classification, data cleansing, and linear regression. 

**Results:** Using historic and current data, I was able to disprove certain media narratives about the mid-range shot, its relevance, and its effect on winning. Additionally, I was able to further classify, describe, and analyze the mid-range shot by introducing a new and more specific variable, the Deep Mid-Range Attempt (DMA). Lastly, using various large data sets, I was able to confirm healthy 3PT trends and efficiency hypotheses that currently lead offensive decision in the NBA.
